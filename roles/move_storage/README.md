# Role move_storage

This role is for compositionalenterprises.ourcompose.move_storage

This moves storage over from local to remote if necessary.

This is for when we want to have some sort of separate storage that is separate from whatever partition /srv is located on.
Typically this would be some sort of cloud volume, or maybe even fast remote storage.
